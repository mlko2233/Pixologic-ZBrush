Pixologic ZBrush allows you to use customizable brushes to shape, texture, and paint virtual clay in real-time that gives you instant feedback. When you use Pixologic ZBrush, you get access to the same tools that artists around the world use.

Here are some of the features and benefits of Pixologic ZBrush:

Dynamics. Pixologic ZBrush introduces a dynamics system that allows any surface to contract, expand, inflate, or drape with gravity. You can use masking to anchor part of the mesh and create a point of interest, or use a mask to create a unique interaction that can allow a surface to curl in on itself. Create realistic folds of fabric - even on a low-resolution plane.

Controlled fabric sculpting. Pixologic ZBrush introduces special brushes that utilize a dynamics system for unique opportunities to interact with the fabric surface. For example, you can choose where creases will lie or simply grab the geometry to move it freely in the workspace and create creases in real time.

Revised Dynamic Subdivision. Dynamic Subdivision provides a working preview of your subdivision levels without actually increasing the base number of polygons. This feature is now developed further, allowing you to add adjustable thickness to any single piece of planar geometry. A piece of geometry can also be added to each polygon as a fully interactive instance.

Additions to SnapShot3D. SnapShot3D now transfers PolyGroups and color from the source texture to the generated mesh. This functionality allows for easy isolation of parts. When creating garment silhouettes, color can be applied to areas that will need holes to create an outfit. These areas can then be quickly hidden and removed for processing with the garment creation dynamics.

Performance. Even more performance improvements have been made to Pixologic ZBrush. We've overhauled the systems behind the sculpting brushes, as well as many other popular features. Speed has increased across the board, including faster response times with highly polygonal models, increased DynaMesh speed, and more.
